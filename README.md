# Units-converter

For this project I created a basic kilogram to pounds and vice versa, converter.
I chose to do this sort of converter after a doctors visit where my weight was measured in kilograms and I did not know the conversion to pounds. 

This app has a text box for kilograms and a text box for pounds. To make it clear on which box is which, there is text in each box indicating pounds or kilograms. There are three button; two enter buttons, one for the kilogram box, one for the pounds box and a reset button. This app is functions best when after the user does one conversion, from pounds to kilograms or kilograms to pounds, they are to use the reset button so that the app will not crash.
